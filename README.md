In this video we will design a #Google map zoom and pan animation with #autoanimate in #Adobexd . Adobe XD is a design & prototype tool that we will be using to create this design. Each artboard of our map will use different position and scale to achieve the goal. Make sure you use same technique otherwise drag will not work. Enjoy :D
